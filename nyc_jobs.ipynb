    "NYC Open Data has released a list of all the open jobs in the city of New York. I downloaded the data in CSV form [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/NYC-Jobs/kpav-sd4t).\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who has the most openings?\n",
    "2. Which departments have the highest and the lowest paying positions (based on current job openings)?\n",
    "3. Which jobs do you think are the hardest to fill? (What makes you say that?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some info to consider that isn't immediately apparent from the dataset at first glance:\n",
    "* Some rows of job listings represent more than one available position with that job title. This is indicated anytime the column \"# Of Positions\" is > 1. This is important for calculating the answer to question 1.\n",
    "* Some rows of job listings have exactly the same Job ID and information, except that one has a Posting Type of Internal and the other External. We should not count these as two separate positions when answering the first two questions, since they technically represent the same job opening that was posted to two different outlets.\n",
    "* The column \"Salary Frequency\" can be Hourly, Daily or Annual. This should be factored into our investigation of question 2.\n",

    "A few things come to mind. Remember that the columms tell us the information available to us: ['Job ID','Agency','Posting Type','# Of Positions','Business Title','Civil Service Title','Title Code No','Level','Salary Range From','Salary Range To','Salary Frequency','Work Location','Division/Work Unit','Job Description','Minimum Qual Requirements','Preferred Skills','Additional Information','To Apply','Hours/Shift','Work Location 1','Recruitment Contact','Residency Requirement','Posting Date','Post Until','Posting Updated','Process Date']\n",

    "Areas to investigate:\n",
    "* __Which jobs have the lowest salaries? What about the highest salaries?__ It's tough to attract job talent when you're offering a low salary, especially in NYC, where the cost of living is so high. Low salaries could prevent qualified people from applying. High salaries, on the other hand, could also be hard to fill. Perhaps a salary is high out of necessity: because a job is so demanding and unappealing. Alternatively, a high salary may indicate that the position requires more specialized knowledge and will compensate accordingly for that knowledge.\n",
    "* __Which jobs have been posted for the longest amount of time?__ Our data source says that the dataset contains **current** job postings. Therefore, we can assume that if a job listing is included in the dataset, it has not yet been filled. My initial thought is that the older a job listing is, the harder it is to fill the position. But there is always the possibility that an agency just forgot to remove the job from the database after the job was filled.\n",
    "* __Which jobs have the most \"# Of Positions\" to fill?__ I'm guessing that the more # of positions available, the harder it must be to fill a particular job.\n",
    "* __Which jobs have the lengthiest \"Minimum Qual Requirements\" or \"Preferred Skills\" fields?__ Perhaps the longer these fields are, the more difficult it is to fill the position because people don't feel qualified for the position, or the hiring manager has higher standards for this position.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, let's get to work! First, we need to drop columns that are not relevant to our investigation and add a \"Mean Salary\" column so we can utilize that info."

    "1. The Department of Health/Mental Hygiene has the most openings.\n",
    "2. From our analysis of current job openings, even though the Office of Management and Budget technically offers the highest mean annual salary, since it only has one position open, it's not necessarily indicative of the agency's salaries as a whole. With 66 annually paid job openings, the Department of Sanitation seems to offer potential candidates the highest annual salaries. The Fire Department offers the highest hourly and daily salaries. The lowest annual salaries go to the Dept of Parks and Recreation. Though this agency is not the lowest on the list, it has the most openings, and is therefore more likely to be indicative of the agency's salaries as a whole when compared to other agencies with low salaries but also a small number of openings. The lowest hourly rate goes to the Office of Collective Bargaining, at \\$9.50/hr. The Dept of Citywide Administrative Services offers the lowest daily pay rate.\n",

Based on the theory that jobs with a) the most openings and b) salaries that aren't especially high are harder to fill, the hardest jobs to fill are: Investigate Consultant Level 1 for the Admin for Children's Services, and School Mental Health Consultant for the Department of Health/Mental Hygiene.
